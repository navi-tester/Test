lyrics:

So if you're lonely
You know I'm here
Waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken
Shattered I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here
With you

I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out

I say you don't show
Don't move time is slow
I say... take me out

I say you don't know
You say you don't go
I say... take me out

If I move this could die
If eyes move this could die
I want you... to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say...take me out

If I wane, this can die
If I wane, this can die
I want you to take me out

If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
